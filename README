***************************************************************
* This submission package contains all the Python modules for *
* my NYC green taxi data analysis project. It also contains   *
* all the figures as .png files (in figures/), a pdf write-up *
* a standard output file stdout, and a README.                *
***************************************************************

1. List of libraries needed:
	a) numpy
	b) pandas
	c) sklearn
	d) matplotlib
	e) scipy

2. To run the program, simply type in the command line:
	python driver.py [is_remove_old_copy] [is_gen_plots]
	[is_remove_old_copy] (Y/n) : Y if choose to force remove the old .csv and re-download (when an old copy exists!)
	[is_gen_plots] (Y/n): Y if generate all the plots (the curve fitting might take some time ...)
	
	For example, if I want a fresh downloaded .csv and I don't want to generate all the plots, simple do
	python driver.py Y N

3. The ETA of the program to finish is ~ 160 secs with the plots generated,
	and ~ 100 secs without generating the plots. Something wrong might
	have happend if it takes much longer than that.

4. List of modules I made:
	a) standard_import.py			- loading libraries and some handy functions
	b) data_cleaning.py				- for data cleaning
	c) feature_engineering.py		- for feature engineering
	d) dist_distribution.py			- for analysis of the trip distance distribution
	e) speed_distribution.py		- for analysis of the speed distribution
	f) model.py						- constructing the predictive model
	g) driver.py					- the driver file

5. All the plots generated is shown in the .pdf write-up

6. The standard output file is generated by the screen output from running the program,
	(without genrating the plots), only for comparison purpose.
